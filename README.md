# Interactive Koch Snowflake
Author: Maeve Farley 

## Compile and Run
install python 

## Description
My project can make koch snowflakes of different orders implementing turtle in python. Some new added features are the user can select the color, if the user adjusts the window the size of the snowflake will change, and the user can draw multiple snowflakes in one run of the code. 

## Test Cases
To tes the code, I increased the order from 1-10 and changed the size using values ranging from 10-500.
